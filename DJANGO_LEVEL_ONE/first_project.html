For working with Django recommended use venv. In this project we will work with Anaconda env. To create new venv use this command:<br>
<strong>conda create --name myDjangoEnv python=3.5.4 django=1.11.8</strong><br>
By default Anaconda installing the latest version of package.<br><br>
To show your environment use <strong>conda info --envs</strong><br>
To activate environment use <strong>source activate myDjangoEnv</strong><br>
To create new Django project use command <strong>django-admin startproject first_project</strong><br>
Python create folder with name of your Django project in root directory with some init files.<br>

<h3>__init__.py</h3>
This is a blank Python script that let's Python know that this directory can be treated as a package
<h3>urls.py</h3>
This is a Python script that will stor all the URL patterns for your project.Basically the different pages of your web application.
<h3>wsgi.py</h3>
This is a Python script that acts as the Web Server Gateway Interface.It will later on help us deploy our web app to production.
<h3>manage.py</h3>
This is a Python script that we will use a lot. It will be associates with many commands as we build our web app!<br>
<p>When we run <strong>python manage.py runserver</strong> we start our webserver with initial page that can be reached by http://localhost:8000</p>
<p>Django project consists of applications that perform a particular functionality and can be reused.</p>
<p>To create some application use command <strong>python manage.py startapp first_app</strong>. This command also create new directory with files.</p>
