To add some media files to your page you can use static files.<br>
First, you need to create new directory inside your project called <strong>static</strong><br>
Then need to add this directory path to the project's settings.py file. We will aslo add a STATIC_URL variable<br>
After that we create <strong>images</strong> directory inside of <strong>static</strong> and can place our image files here.<br>
Now we can go to 127.0.0.1:8000/static/images/pict.jpg and check that it works.
